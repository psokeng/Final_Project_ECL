1.  Any evidence that the big airlines started to alter their operating models due to the pandemic. Were airlines still following the hub model, or were they adopting more of a 
       point-to-point model (the hypothesis being that travellers would want to reduce their connection points and time at or near airports)? 
      What conclusions can we draw when comparing datasets?

2. Looking at the overall routes (origin & destination) for specific airlines (these can be the same or different from 1.), can you identify scheduled routes that had been completely   removed in the
 June 15th 2020 dataset? (For example, in 2019 London-Dubai was a popular route, but in 2020 there were no airlines planning to operate between these two airports.)

3. For the routes remaining, can you see a reduction in the number of airlines operating a particular route? (For example, London to New York in 2019 had five airlines competing daily, but in
 2020 there were only two airlines competing.)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62950630/120405494-ab907500-c316-11eb-952e-8739f320360f.png)
